              </head>
              <body>

                            + Reads from top to bottom
                            + if two rules are on one elements, everything at the bottom 
                            rules out the top.

7. IDs & Classes --> Ways to specify/target specific elements.

                    + Classes can target multiple elements

                            color: blue;
                        }

10. Positioning --> Used to move, manipulate and reposition elements within the document
                    browser flow.
                    + Uses "top", "bottom", "left", and "right" properties to move
                    + 4 Types:
                        - Static --> Default position

                        - Relative --> Moves indepently starting from accompanying 
                                       property.

                        - Absolute --> Separates from the entire document flow
                                       - Position against the 1st non-static element
                                       - Positions in the body if all elements are
                                         static.

                        - Fixed --> Similar to Absolute, but stays fixed to the browser
                                    window in a set position.
                        
                        - Sticky --> Positions off of the scroll position of a user.
                                    - Switches between relative and fixed.
